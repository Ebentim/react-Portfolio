            <p>In 2021, I set out on a journey to become a frontend developer, with the goal of creating apps for my KaiOS phone. Despite facing initial challenges, I discovered an HTML text editor on the phone's app store and that sparked the beginning of my coding adventure. With sheer determination, I dived into the world of coding, studying through PDFs and eBooks on my phone, without even owning a laptop.</p>
            <p>Today, in 2024, I proudly hold the title of a META certified frontend developer. My skillset has expanded tremendously, encompassing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Bootstrap, making me proficient in crafting intuitive and responsive interfaces. With my knowledge of version control, I lead projects effectively, ensuring optimal collaboration and efficiency.</p>
            <p>This journey has been a testament to my resilience, self-guided learning, and an unwavering commitment to growth. As I continue to evolve, I am motivated to leverage my skills to create innovative and impactful digital experiences in the ever-evolving landscape of frontend development.</p>
